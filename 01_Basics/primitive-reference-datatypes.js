// according to the process of save the data and assess the data the datatypes are categorized into two categories: 
// primitive and reference types(non-primitive).

// Primitive 

// 7 types of primitive data types in JavaScript
// 1. Number: Represents both integer and floating-point numbers.
// 2. String: Represents a sequence of characters enclosed in single, double, or backticks.
// 3. Boolean: Represents a logical entity and can have two values: true or false.
// 4. Undefined: A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
// 5. Null: Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
// 6. Symbol: A unique and immutable value often used as object property keys.
// 7. BigInt: Represents integers with arbitrary precision, useful for very large numbers.


// Reference (Non-Primitive)

// 1. Object: A collection of key-value pairs, where keys are strings (or Symbols) and values can be any data type.
// 2. Array: A special type of object used to store ordered collections of values.
// 3. Function: A callable object that can be invoked to perform a specific task.


// 4. Date: An object that represents a specific point in time.
// 5. RegExp: An object that represents a regular expression, used for pattern matching in strings.
// 6. Map: A collection of key-value pairs where keys can be of any type, maintaining insertion order.
// 7. Set: A collection of unique values, where each value can only occur once.
// 8. WeakMap: Similar to Map, but keys must be objects and are weakly referenced, allowing for garbage collection.
// 9. WeakSet: Similar to Set, but values must be objects and are weakly referenced, allowing for garbage collection.
// 10. ArrayBuffer: A generic, fixed-length binary data buffer used for low-level data manipulation.
// 11. Typed Arrays: Specialized array-like objects for handling binary data, such as Int8Array, Uint8Array, Float32Array, etc.
// 12. Promise: An object representing the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
// 13. Proxy: An object that wraps another object or function, allowing for custom behavior when accessing or modifying properties.
// 14. Reflect: An object that provides methods for interceptable JavaScript operations, similar to Proxy but without the custom behavior.
// 15. Error: An object that represents an error that occurs during the execution of a program, providing information about the error type and message.
// 16. JSON: An object that provides methods for parsing and stringifying JSON data, allowing for easy data interchange between systems.
// 17. Intl: An object that provides language-sensitive functions for formatting numbers, dates, and strings, supporting internationalization.
// 18. WeakRef: An object that holds a weak reference to another object, allowing it to be garbage collected if there are no strong references.
// 19. FinalizationRegistry: An object that allows you to register a callback to be called when an object is garbage collected, useful for cleanup tasks.
// 20. SharedArrayBuffer: A special type of ArrayBuffer that can be shared between workers, allowing for concurrent data manipulation.
// 21. Atomics: An object that provides atomic operations for shared memory, allowing for safe concurrent access to shared data.
// 22. DataView: An object that provides a low-level interface for reading and writing multiple number types in an ArrayBuffer, allowing for flexible data manipulation.
// 23. Intl.Collator: An object that provides methods for comparing strings according to locale-specific rules, useful for sorting and searching.
// 24. Intl.NumberFormat: An object that provides methods for formatting numbers according to locale-specific rules, useful for displaying numbers in a user-friendly way.
// 25. Intl.DateTimeFormat: An object that provides methods for formatting dates and times according to locale-specific rules, useful for displaying dates in a user-friendly way.
// 26. Intl.ListFormat: An object that provides methods for formatting lists of items according to locale-specific rules, useful for displaying lists in a user-friendly way.
// 27. Intl.RelativeTimeFormat: An object that provides methods for formatting relative time strings according to locale-specific rules, useful for displaying time differences in a user-friendly way.
// 28. Intl.PluralRules: An object that provides methods for determining the plural form of a word based on a number and locale, useful for internationalization.
// 29. Intl.Locale: An object that represents a locale, providing information about the language, region, and script of the locale, useful for internationalization.
// 30. Intl.DisplayNames: An object that provides methods for formatting names of languages, regions, and scripts according to locale-specific rules, useful for displaying names in a user-friendly way.
// 31. Intl.Segmenter: An object that provides methods for segmenting text into grapheme clusters, words, or sentences according to locale-specific rules, useful for text processing and analysis.
// 32. Intl.LocaleMatcher: An object that provides methods for matching a locale against a list of available locales, useful for determining the best locale to use for formatting or displaying data.
